My guess is you are installing by right clicking on the INF in the explorer 
or using Rundll32. In that case, remove .NT and .NTam64 decorations and see 
if it works. It seems shell install only understand DefaultInstall section. 
If it works on XP and not on Vista, this could be a compat issue introduced 
by shell team.
